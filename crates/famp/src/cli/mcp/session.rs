//! Per-process MCP session state — Phase 2 reshape (D-04 + D-10).
//!
//! ## Why module-scope, not per-session-id keyed
//!
//! MCP stdio transport launches one `famp mcp` subprocess per client
//! window (Claude Code and Codex both do this). Within a single process
//! there is exactly one session. So session state collapses to a single
//! `OnceLock` + `Mutex` over [`SessionState`] at module scope. We do **not**
//! introduce a `HashMap<SessionId, _>` — there is no second session to
//! key off.
//!
//! ## Phase 2 shape
//!
//! Two pieces of state:
//!
//! - the optional `BusClient` field — the long-lived UDS connection to
//!   the local broker. Lazily opened on first tool call via [`ensure_bus`].
//! - the optional canonical-identity field — the name this MCP server
//!   has registered as. `None` until [`set_active_identity`] is called
//!   by `tools::register::call` after a successful `RegisterOk`.
//!
//! ## D-10: MCP is the registered slot, NOT a proxy
//!
//! Per D-10 (CONTEXT.md), the MCP server is a real long-lived process
//! that calls `famp_register` and BECOMES THE registered slot for its
//! session — it is **not** a proxy that rides on someone else's
//! `famp register` daemon. So [`ensure_bus`] opens the [`BusClient`] with
//! `bind_as: None` (canonical-holder shape). The `Register` frame
//! (sent by `tools/register.rs::call`) is what later sets the
//! canonical `state.name` for the connection on the broker side.
//!
//! Contrast: one-shot CLI subcommands (`famp send`, `famp inbox list`,
//! …) connect with `bind_as: Some(name)` and ride on a long-running
//! `famp register <name>` daemon. The MCP server stands in for that
//! daemon within a Claude Code window's lifetime.
//!
//! ## Concurrency
//!
//! `tokio::sync::Mutex`: the only writer is `tools::register::call`
//! and reads happen at most once per in-flight tool call (stdio is
//! serially driven). Contention is structurally bounded.
