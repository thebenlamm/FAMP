# FAMP — Federated Agent Messaging Protocol (Reference Implementation)

## What This Is

A Rust implementation of FAMP (Federated Agent Messaging Protocol) v0.5.1, staged in **two profiles** so a single developer can get a usable library before the full federation-grade semantics are built out.

1. **Personal Profile (v0.6 + v0.7)** — the minimum usable library. Byte-exact canonical JSON, Ed25519-signed envelopes with domain separation, a four-state task lifecycle, and an in-process `MemoryTransport`. Goal: one developer can wire two locally-trusted agents in a single binary and run a signature-verified `request → commit → deliver` cycle end to end.

2. **Federation Profile (v0.8+)** — adds the semantics that matter at ecosystem scale: Agent Cards + federation credentials, negotiation/counter-proposal, the three delegation forms, provenance graphs, an extensions registry, an HTTP transport binding, the adversarial conformance matrix, and Level 2 + Level 3 conformance badges.

The signing substrate is the same in both profiles. Canonicalization, signing, and core types are done once and correctly in v0.6; Personal Profile exercises that substrate against a minimal runtime in v0.7; Federation Profile stacks ecosystem semantics on top without re-deriving the interop bytes.

## Core Value

**A byte-exact, signature-verifiable FAMP substrate a single developer can use from their own code today, and two independent parties can interop against later.** If canonicalization or signature verification disagrees, nothing else matters — so Personal Profile exercises the same signing contract Federation Profile will depend on.

## Requirements

### Active — Personal Profile (v0.6 + v0.7)

**v0.6 Foundation Crates — substrate: COMPLETE ✓**

**v0.7 Personal Runtime — minimal usable library (next):**
- [ ] `famp-envelope` — signed envelope with INV-10 enforcement; body schemas for `request`, `commit`, `deliver`, `ack`, `control/cancel` only
- [ ] Minimal task lifecycle FSM: `REQUESTED → COMMITTED → {COMPLETED | FAILED | CANCELLED}` (4 states, compiler-checked terminals). No `REJECTED`, no `EXPIRED`, no timeouts.
- [ ] `famp-transport` trait + `MemoryTransport` (in-process, ~50 LoC)
- [ ] Trust-on-first-use keyring — local `HashMap<Principal, VerifyingKey>`, principal = raw Ed25519 pubkey. No Agent Card.
- [ ] `famp-transport-http` (minimal) — axum `POST /famp/v0.5.1/inbox` endpoint, `reqwest` client send, rustls TLS, 1 MB body limit, signature-verification middleware before routing. **No** `.well-known` Agent Card distribution (TOFU keyring only), **no** cancellation-safe spawn-channel pattern.
- [ ] `famp/examples/personal_two_agents.rs` — end-to-end signed request/commit/deliver in one binary via `MemoryTransport`, with typed trace
- [ ] `famp/examples/cross_machine_two_agents.rs` — same flow across two processes/machines via HTTP, bootstrapped from a local keyring file or CLI flags (no Agent Card fetch)
- [ ] Minimal negative tests: unsigned rejected, wrong-key rejected, canonical divergence detected — run against **both** transports

### Deferred — Federation Profile (v0.8+)

These are tracked in `REQUIREMENTS.md` but are **not v1-blocking**. They matter at ecosystem scale, not for a personally-usable library.

- **Agent Card + federation credential + trust registry** — Personal Profile uses a local pubkey keyring; Federation Profile adds the card format, self-signature resolution, capability declaration, and pluggable trust store.
- **`famp-causality` beyond `in_reply_to`** — freshness windows, bounded replay cache, supersession, idempotency-key scoping all defer.
- **Negotiation / counter-proposal / round limits** (`famp-protocol`) — Personal Profile uses direct `request → commit`; no `propose` body.
- **Three delegation forms** (`assist`, `subtask`, `transfer`) + transfer timeout + delegation ceiling — defer entire `famp-delegate` crate.
- **Provenance graph** (`famp-provenance`) — deterministic construction, redaction, signed terminal reports all defer.
- **Extensions registry** (`famp-extensions`) — critical/non-critical classification, INV-9 fail-closed. Defer.
- **HTTP transport — Agent-Card-aware pieces only.** Personal V1 ships a minimal HTTP binding (inbox endpoint, reqwest client, rustls, sig-verification middleware). Deferred: `.well-known` Agent Card distribution (TRANS-05), cancellation-safe spawn-channel send path (TRANS-08).
- **Adversarial conformance matrix** — replay, stale commit, canonical divergence, silent delegation, competing commits, round overflow, drop-at-every-await, key rotation. Personal Profile ships a minimal 3-case negative suite only.
- **`stateright` model checking** — defer; `proptest` transition-legality tests are sufficient for Personal Profile.
- **Level 2 (Conversational) + Level 3 (Task-capable) conformance badges** — defer to Federation Profile. Personal Profile is not a conformance-release target.
- **CLI (`famp keygen`, `famp envelope sign`, `famp serve`, …)** — library-first; CLI lands with Federation Profile.

### Out of Scope (permanent)

- **Python/TypeScript bindings in v1** — core must be proven first; bindings follow as separate milestone
- **Additional transports (libp2p, NATS, WebSocket)** — `Transport` trait leaves them open; not v1
- **Multi-party commitment profiles** — spec §23 Q1 explicitly defers; bilateral only
- **Cross-federation delegation** — spec §23 Q3; bilateral peering not defined
- **Streaming (token-by-token) deliver** — spec §23 Q2; `interim: true` deliveries sufficient
- **Economic/reputation/payment layers** — spec §21 exclusions stand
- **Agent lifecycle management** (start/stop/upgrade/monitor) — out of protocol scope per §21
- **Production deployment tooling** — library-first; ops concerns deferred

## Context

**Starting state:** Repository contains only `FAMP-v0.5-spec.md` (1178 lines, the protocol spec itself). No code, no git history, no Rust toolchain installed.

**Prior review findings (4 parallel review agents):** Loaded in conversation history. Key categories:

1. **Canonical JSON** is the #1 blocker — spec says "sorted keys, no whitespace" but doesn't reference RFC 8785 JCS. Without lockdown, two conformant implementations will produce different bytes and signature verification will fail. Must resolve in Phase 1 (spec fork).

2. **State-machine holes** — real spec bugs, not just under-specification:
   - §9.6 ack-disposition conflated with terminal-state crystallization
   - §7.3 "no body inspection" claim is false (`interim` flag, partial acceptance subset, control target live in body)
   - Transfer-timeout reversion vs. in-flight delegate commit race
   - EXPIRED vs. in-flight deliver not covered by delivery-wins default
   - INV-5 violated by competing-instance commits during resolution window
   - Conditional-lapse loses to delivery-wins (should win)
   - Negotiation round counting under supersession ambiguous
   - Capability snapshot binding contradicts card-version rule

3. **Under-specified body schemas** — `commit`, `propose`, `deliver`, `control` bodies undefined. Must write schemas before coding or implementations cannot interop.

4. **Security gaps** — no domain-separation prefix in signatures, no recipient binding, idempotency key collision surface, Agent Card self-signature is circular (needs federation credential), SHA-256 artifact encoding unspecified.

**Developer background:** User is new to Rust. Phase 0 covers toolchain install, workspace scaffold, and basic `cargo test` loop before any FAMP code is written.

**Why Rust:** Ed25519 and canonical JSON demand byte-exact behavior; `match` on enums makes INV-5 (single terminal state) and the task FSM compiler-checked in ways a Python/TS implementation can only approximate at runtime. One Rust core can later feed Python/TS/Go bindings via wasm-bindgen or PyO3.

## Constraints

- **Tech stack**: Rust (stable, latest). `ed25519-dalek` for signatures, `serde` + custom canonicalizer for RFC 8785 JCS, `proptest` + `stateright` for state-machine model checking, `axum` or `hyper` for HTTP transport reference.
- **Tech stack (deferred)**: No Python/TS bindings in v1; keep FFI surface clean but unwired.
- **Transport**: HTTP/1.1 + JSON over TLS as reference wire; in-process `MemoryTransport` for tests. Other transports live behind the `Transport` trait.
- **Conformance target**: Level 2 + Level 3 in one milestone. Level 1-only is explicitly not a release target.
- **Spec fidelity**: v0.5.1 fork is the authority for this implementation. All diffs from v0.5 documented with reviewer rationale.
- **Security**: Every message signed (INV-10); unsigned messages rejected. Ed25519 non-negotiable. Domain separation prefix added in v0.5.1 fork.
- **Developer onboarding**: Rust toolchain install is Phase 0; assume zero prior Rust experience.

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Language: Rust | Compiler-checked invariants (INV-5 via enum `match`), byte-exact Ed25519 and canonical JSON, single core can feed future bindings | — Pending |
| **Personal Profile before Federation Profile** | Solo-dev usability is the near-term goal; federation-grade semantics (delegation taxonomy, provenance graph, Agent Cards, adversarial matrix, conformance badges) are expensive and mostly matter at ecosystem scale. Ship the signing substrate + a minimal usable runtime first, then stack federation on top without changing the substrate. | **Adopted 2026-04-12** |
| ~~Ship Level 2 + Level 3 together as v1~~ | **Superseded 2026-04-12.** Rationale still valid for Federation Profile, but Personal Profile explicitly is not a conformance-release target. Level 2 + Level 3 badges now live in Federation Profile. | Superseded |
| Fork spec to v0.5.1 rather than write profile addendum | State-machine findings are real bugs not ambiguities; profile-that-contradicts-spec causes interop confusion | — Pending |
| Both `MemoryTransport` and `HttpTransport` in v1 | Memory transport is ~50 lines and makes full-flow tests run in microseconds; HTTP is the wire reference everyone points at | — Pending |
| RFC 8785 JCS for canonical JSON | Only widely-reviewed canonical JSON spec; avoids inventing our own corner-case rules for Unicode/number/duplicate-key handling | — Pending |
| Ed25519 key encoding: raw 32-byte pub / 64-byte sig, unpadded base64url | Matches `ed25519-dalek` defaults; simplest interop contract | — Pending |
| Artifact IDs: `sha256:<hex>` prefix scheme | SHA-256 is "RECOMMENDED" in spec; hex encoding is canonical and unambiguous | — Pending |
| Test strategy: conformance vectors → FSM model checking → adversarial suite → two-node integration | Each layer catches a distinct failure class; vectors are the interop contract future implementations hold us to | — Pending |

## Current Milestone: v0.6 Foundation Crates (Personal Profile — part 1 of 2)

**Goal:** Deliver byte-exact canonical JSON and signature-verifiable Ed25519 primitives, plus compiler-checked core types — the substrate every downstream FAMP crate (Personal and Federation profiles alike) signs against.

**Target crates:**
- `famp-canonical` — RFC 8785 JCS canonicalization with an external-vector conformance gate (SEED-001)
- `famp-crypto` — Ed25519 sign/verify with domain-separation prefix (v0.5.1 §7.1) and raw 32/64-byte base64url-unpadded wire encoding
- `famp-core` — shared types, errors, and invariant scaffolding (INV-1..11) used by every other crate

**Success shape:** `just ci` green; RFC 8785 external test vectors byte-exact; worked Ed25519 example from PITFALLS P10 verifies in Rust; `famp-core` types compile-check INV-5 exhaustiveness via enum `match`.

**Phase numbering:** reset to Phase 1 (v0.5.1 was a doc milestone; v0.6 is the first code milestone).

## Next Milestone: v0.7 Personal Runtime (Personal Profile — part 2 of 2)

**Goal:** A single developer can run the same signed `request → commit → deliver` cycle **two ways**: (a) in one binary via `MemoryTransport`, and (b) across two machines / two processes via a minimal HTTP binding, with trust bootstrapped from a local keyring file. This is the finish line for "something I can use myself."

**Target crates / deliverables:**
- `famp-envelope` — signed envelope with mandatory-signature enforcement; body schemas for **only** `request`, `commit`, `deliver`, `ack`, `control/cancel`. Negotiation, delegation, announce, describe bodies explicitly omitted.
- Minimal task FSM — 4 states (`REQUESTED → COMMITTED → {COMPLETED | FAILED | CANCELLED}`), compiler-checked terminals, no `stateright` model check (defer), no timeouts.
- `famp-transport` trait + `MemoryTransport` (in-process, ~50 LoC).
- `famp-transport-http` **minimal subset**: axum `POST /famp/v0.5.1/inbox` endpoint, `reqwest` client send, rustls TLS, 1 MB body-size limit, signature-verification middleware running **before** routing. No `.well-known` Agent Card distribution (TRANS-05), no cancellation-safe spawn-channel send (TRANS-08) — both defer to Federation Profile.
- Trust-on-first-use keyring — local `HashMap<Principal, VerifyingKey>`; principal = raw Ed25519 pubkey, bootstrapped from a keyring file or CLI flags. No Agent Card, no federation credential, no trust registry.
- `famp/examples/personal_two_agents.rs` — end-to-end happy path in one binary via `MemoryTransport`, printing a typed trace.
- `famp/examples/cross_machine_two_agents.rs` — same flow across two processes via HTTP. Both ends load the other's pubkey from a local file.
- Negative tests run against **both** transports: unsigned rejected, wrong-key rejected, canonical divergence detected. Three cases × two transports, not eighteen.

**Explicitly NOT in v0.7:** Agent Card, federation credential, trust registry, `.well-known` distribution, negotiation/counter-proposal, three delegation forms, provenance graph, extensions registry, `stateright` model checking, adversarial conformance matrix, Level 2/3 badges, CLI, cancellation-safe send path. All move to Federation Profile milestones v0.8+.

**Success shape:** `cargo run --example personal_two_agents` prints a signed conversation trace and exits 0; running `cross_machine_two_agents` server in one shell and client in another completes the same cycle over HTTPS; the three negative tests fail closed with typed errors on both transports; `just ci` green.
